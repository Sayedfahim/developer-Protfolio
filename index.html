            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Sayed Wadud Islam. I have completed my Bsc in CSE at Daffodil International University.
                I’m highly motivated and an extremely passionate about Web developing. I am known for completing
                projects
                ahead of deadlines, and I feel this is especially important when things are constantly evolving and
                changing. I would say my biggest weakness is don’t have a lot of work experience, but I’m a fast-learner
                and
                am highly adaptable.
                I would say that people would describe me as a good communicator because I’m always able to articulate
                people’s needs, whether it be clients or my teammates.
                In my lazure time I love to play video games. I often like to watch football matches. </p>
