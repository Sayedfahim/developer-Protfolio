            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Sayed Wadud Islam.I have completed my Bsc in CSE at Daffodil International University.
                I’m highly motivated and am extremely passionate about Web developing.I am known for completing projects
                ahead of deadlines, and I feel this is especially important when things are constantly evolving and
                changing. I would say my biggest weakness is don’t have a lot of work experience, but I’m a fast-learner and
                am highly adaptable.
                I would say that people would describe me as a good communicator because I’m always able to articulate
                people’s needs, whether it be clients or my teammates.
                In my lazure time I love to play video games. I often like to watch football matches. </p>
